Assignments CheckList
=====================

### Overview
- Every assignment should be in its own folder.
- All code presented should run.
- Comments are expected
- A README.md file describing project and group members is expected in every assignment folder.
- You will have to at least start running each script to show it runs. 


Scraping Data
======

For me to grade this, I will just need to see your repository page to make sure everything is present and instructions were followed. You will have to show me that your `run.py` file runs without error.

| :four:       | A csv or json file exists and contains scraped data.                         | 20       |        |
| :five:       | There are a minimum of 100 rows of data in the json/csv file.                | 20       |        |
| :six:        | The code actually scraped html and not just txt or tabular data on a server. | 25       |        |

Simple Regression
=================

I will just need to see your repository page to make sure everything is present and instructions were followed. You will have to show me that your `run.py` file runs without error and generates the pyplot image.

Occupied Parking Space Project
==============================

Again, I will need to see your repository page to make sure everything is present and instructions were followed. You will have to show me that your `process_lot.py` file runs without error and generates output.

| :six:        | Extracted images are saved to `spaces` folder. | 25       |        |
| :seven:      | Histograms are saved to `histograms` folder.   | 25       |        |

====================

Same instructions, code must run, repo must contain correct files.
