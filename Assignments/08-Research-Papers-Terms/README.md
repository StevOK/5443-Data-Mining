## Assignment 8 - Key Terms
#### Due: November 10 (Friday) by Midnight.

As we read through all of the research presentations, we start to see many common terms as well as some specific terms 
for each paper. As an example, in "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" we see terms like:

- convolution layers
- deep / wide neural networks (or network depth / width)
- convergance
- vanishing / exploding gradients
- normalized initialization
- etc.

Just to list a few. And by looking into "depth of a network", I came across "width of a network" as another common term.

This assignment is for each group to add the specific and common terms to this repos [wiki page](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5443-Data-Mining/wiki).

- The criteria for grading will be how comprehensive a groups list is in regards to the specific terms from thier paper, and how many common terms they add or edit in the wiki.
- I expect by the end of all groups additions, we should have a comprehensive list of definitions with examples in the class wiki page.
- You should also know that if I feel that the wiki is comprehensive enough, then we will use it as the study guide for our 1 test in the class. 
- If it is not comprehensive enough, then I will simply provide a list of terms without any additional material as your study guide.


#### Deliverables

- ***1)*** Add your key terms to the course [wiki page](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5443-Data-Mining/wiki) sidbar first in alphabetical Order. Or create a sub-group of a "class" of definitions.
- ***2)*** A your definition / explanation to the page associated with that term.
    - Red links are terms with no page defined.
    - Blue links are terms with an existing page.
- ***3)*** Feel free to edit an existing page to add a source, or to add images etc.. Anything to make the explanation more clear.
