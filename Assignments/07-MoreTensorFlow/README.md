## More Tensor Flow
#### Assignment Due: 16 Oct by class time.

Below is a list of resources that I have been using to understand tensor flow. I could regurgitate those
concepts in class, or you can spend your time learning them, and we can discuss them in class.

- This video does an excellent job describing a neural network.
    - [But what *is* a Neural Network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=0s)

- Get comfortable with Tensor Flow Terminology and structures
  - https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started
      - tensors
      - computational graph
      - placeholders
      - variables
      - `tf.global_variables_initializer()`
      - `sess.run(init)`
      - tf.train
      - tf.estimator

- Another Tensor Flow tutorial, using concepts from above to solve a problem
  - [Tensor Flow Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial)
      - [Sign Data](http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/)

- [Softmax vs Sigmoid](http://dataaspirant.com/2017/03/07/difference-between-softmax-function-and-sigmoid-function/)

- Same MNIST tutorial I've mentioned before. It should make more sense at this point.
